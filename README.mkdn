Getting Started
===============

This fork is setup for the CDMA variants of the LG Optimus One only.  Skipping all of the other, irrelevant, phones speeds up the inherently slow config/build process.  To 
merge this back into the main CM tree or get other devices built with this tree, revert/ignore the changes to:

- products/common.mk 
- products/AndroidProducts.mk
- vendorsetup.sh
